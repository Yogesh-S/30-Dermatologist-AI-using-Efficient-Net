# Skin Cancer Detection using EfficientNet-B7

In this notebook, we will design an algorithm that can visually diagnose melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. In particular, the algorithm will distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions (nevi and seborrheic keratoses).
